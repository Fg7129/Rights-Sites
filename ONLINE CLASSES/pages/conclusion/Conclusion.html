                <h1>Conclusion: How to Change the World</h1>
                <p id="conclusionText">
                    Human rights are the foundation of a just and equitable society, yet the journey toward ensuring these rights for all people is ongoing. Change starts with each individual’s commitment to understanding and advocating for the rights of others, regardless of nationality, race, gender, or any other distinguishing factor. By raising awareness, challenging unjust systems, and amplifying marginalized voices, we can collectively drive social, political, and cultural transformation.
                    <span id="hiddenMessage" style="display:none;">If we want to change the world we need to change ourselves first. If you listed to different world by Alan Walker it says<u>"This is not the world we had in mind, but we got time and"</u> and we can change the world. That was the message of the song, to help make a better version of our world but we need to make a better version of <u>ourselves first</u>. <u>Our world used to be a thriving with life</u>, and now that life is in danger.<u> We are stuck on answers we can't find, but we got time and we can find those answers</u>, change the world.<u> Make a better world where climate change doesn't exist, Child abuse is no longer, Mental illnesses is a mental what now?, equal rights of both genders and more. We just do it one small solusion at a time.</u> Then finaly have a sustainable world. Knowing this will not change the world but taking action will! We can do that by:<u> making websites to inform people about it, donate money to planting more trees, not planting trees in random areas(in were trees have been cut is just fine), using (solar,wind,water,nuclear) energy and more, be nice to people who are different because they are people to and more</u>. Because you can do anything if you believe and put the hard work into it.Together, we have the power to create a future where human rights are universally upheld and celebrated. Let us commit to taking intentional actions today that will resonate for generations to come.</span>
