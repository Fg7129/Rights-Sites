        <h1>DEPRESSION(MENTAL ILLNESSES)</h1>

        <p>Depression is a mental health condition that affects a person's mood, thoughts, and physical well-being. It's more than just feeling "down" for a few days; it can persist for weeks, months, or even longer, making everyday tasks feel overwhelming.</p>

        <p>Common signs and feelings people with depression might experience include: </p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Persistent sadness or emptiness.</b></li>

            <li><b>Loss of interest.</b></li>

            <li><b>Fatigue or lack of energy.</b></li>

            <li><b>Difficulty concentrating.</b></li>

            <li><b>Physical symptoms.</b></li>

            <li><b>Thoughts of suicide</b></li>
        </ol>

                
        

        <h2>TYPES OF DEPRESSION:</h2>

        <P>There are many types of it, so I will tell you the main types of depression:</P>

        <ol>
           <li><h3>Major Depressive Disorder(MDD)</h3>This is characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest in most daily activities, lasting at least 2 weeks.</li>

           <li><h3>Dystymia</h3>This is a chronic form of depression with symptoms that are less severe but las for at least 2 years.</li>

           <li><h3>Bipolar Disorder.</h3>It involves alternating periods of depression and mania or hypomania.</li>

           <li><h3>Seasonal Affective Disorder.</h3>A type of depression that occurs seasonally most commonly during less sunny months.</li>

           <li><h3>Postpartum Depression</h3>This occurs after childbirth.</li>

           <li><h3>Psychotic Depression</h3>This is a severe form of depression that is accompanied by psychosis such as delusions or hallucinations</li>

           <li><h3>Atypical Depression</h3>Atypical depression is a subtype of major depression characterized by specific features like temporary mood improvement in response to positive events (called "mood reactivity") increased sleep and appetite ,weight gain and heavy limbs.It's considered atypical because it doesn't fit the typical pattern of depression</li>

        </ol>

        <p>Those and others are types of depression.</p>

        <p>The hardest one to recognize is <u>Atypical Depression</u> because they could be depressed for years and you could not notice! Other times, it is caused because of being insalted, or harased for a long time, but they deside to hide it. They could have been rejected from a person to be their friend or even relatives, so they decide to change themselves and even forget who they are in the process. If they find somebody who does not care if they are silly,joking,hyperactive,joyfull,smart,dumb(no offence),cleanminded,dirtyminded or anything else, they like hanging out with them.</p>
        
        <p>Other examples of mental illnesses are:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Anxiety Disorders</li>

            <li>Mood Disorders</li>

            <li>Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders</li>

            <li>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</li>

            <li>Eating Disorders</li>

            <li>Psychotic Disorders</li>

            <li> Neurodevelopmental Disorders</li>

            <li>Personality Disorders</li>

            <li> Substance Use Disorders</li>

            <li>Neurocognitive Disorders</li>
        </ol>

        <p>It's essential to recognize that mental health is complex and can be influenced by genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Anyone experiencing significant distress should seek support from a mental health professional to receive proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>

        <p>Sometimes technology can give you the wrong information and it can make somepeople depressed or make somepeople think of things that are not for their age.For  example:BRAINROT.</p>

        <h2>Examples of BRAINROT.</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><h4>Slang and trends like:</h4>"skibidi","rizz","gyatt","fanum tax","sigma" are examples of slang and trends associated with brainrot.</li>

            <li><h4>Internet-speak like:</h4>Using internet-speak in place of more appropriate language, such as saying "slay queen" instead of "congratulations".</li>

            <li><h4>Constantly online</h4>Spending too much time online, which can interfere with daily activities. This can include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Not being able to sleep because of your phone.</li>

                <li>Prioritizing online relationships over in-person ones.</li>

        <p>We can use technology for many things (Good or Bad.) but it has brought us so for from simple cavemen to a thriving civilization were a cough will no longer kill yo, were we are defeating diseases like:tuberculosis,dyesentery,colera,bilhazia and others which seemed imposible to beat,We have almost found the cure to cancer and other diseases that we still struggle with to day and all with the help of technology.Here is a video that explains more on that.</p>

        <p>Lives have been saved by technology, that is why technology is so important, even though people are scammed,kidnapped,lied to,exposed to things that are not for their age on the internet/tech, it does not mean that their isn't a good side to it either,people have leart things like climate change and are also helping to try and reduce it,they have leart new skills on the internet and more.That is the pros and cons of technology, because every rose has its thorns / nothing and nobody is prefect.</p><br><br>
